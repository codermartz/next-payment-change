# Next Payment Change

I built this WordPress plugin for simplistic demonstration when dealing with WooCommerce Subscriptions. Basically, it updates the next payment date of a subscription after the customer buys any subscriptions then sends an email to the admin for notification.

Can be a good starting point for someone wanting to learn how to change the next payment date of a subscription item after a user has completed its payment for it. Enjoy!
